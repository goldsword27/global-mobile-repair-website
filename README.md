# Global Mobile Repair - Remote Phone Repair Services

## Introduction

This project is a website for **Global Mobile Repair**, offering remote phone repair services. The goal is to provide a convenient way for customers to have their phones repaired from the comfort of their homes using remote access tools. The website explains the services offered, showcases features, and guides users on how to get their phones repaired quickly and securely.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into four main sections:

1. **Main Page**: A comprehensive description of remote phone repair services using tools such as TeamViewer, UltraViewer, etc. This page explains the remote repair processes and services offered for Android phones.

2. **Shop**: Accessible from the navigation bar, the shop allows users to purchase relevant products. Customers can add products to the cart and provide card and address details for secure transactions. The integration of **Stripe.com** is planned for added security in future releases.

3. **Learn**: In accordance with the assignment requirements, a Learning Management System (LMS) was chosen. **Moodle** was used to create lessons on various topics. A 20-question medium to hard-level quiz was added for users to test their knowledge after studying the lessons. The results are shown to users, including correct answers, incorrect answers, and scores.

4. **About Me**: This section was implemented outside of the main site via WordPress. The purpose was to learn how to utilize CMS independently of the primary site integration.
